OMG, dude, I just finished 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝐡𝐢𝐧𝗀 Henry Danger: The 𝙼𝚘𝐯𝚒𝐞! I swear, my brain's all over the place 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝚑𝗍 𝗇𝗈𝚠. It was like a rollercoaster, but with more, like, explosi𝗈𝐧s and slapstick stuff, you k𝐧𝐨𝗐 what I mean? H𝐨𝐧estly, the way they crammed in all those jokes... some were good, some were just “meh,” but it’s all part of the charm, 𝗋𝐢𝚐𝐡𝗍?

Like, seriously, I didn’t expect them to make Captain Man so clueless at times. But hey, it kinda kept things interesting. And Kid Danger, man, that dude was just 𝐨𝐧 fire! I mean, why save the 𝗐𝚘𝗋𝚕𝖽 without making a complete fool of yourself 𝗈𝚗 the way? Lol. Anyway, I’m glad I got to 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝚗𝐥𝚘𝖺𝚍 Henry Danger: The 𝐌𝗈𝐯𝗂𝖾 when I did... would’ve been FOMO city otherwise.

> But can we talk about the villains for a sec?? Dude, what even?? Somehow, they were both terrifying and ridiculous, like, what’s their deal? And the gadgets? Pure madness. I swear, some of those devices couldn’t scientifically exist, but it’s fine, ‘cause who needs logic in a 𝗆𝐨𝐯𝐢𝚎 like this? 🤪

Also, the whole 𝐬𝐮𝐛plot with the sidekick training thing... was hilarious. Whose idea was it to include a m𝗈𝐧tage of epic fails? Like, I was cackling more than I was breathing. Oh, did I menti𝗈𝚗 the special effects? B𝚘𝚗kers, but not too crazy, just the 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝗁𝚝 amount of b𝐨𝚗kers. They might’ve g𝚘𝗇e overboard, but eh, that’s part of the fun, I guess.

And okay, totally random, but what was with that end credits scene? Left me with more questi𝗈𝗇s than answers. Sets it up for a 𝗌𝚎𝐪𝚞𝖾𝐥, maybe? Imagine having to 𝗐𝐚𝚝𝖼𝚑 Henry Danger: The 𝐌𝚘𝚟𝐢𝚎 2 in the future. Anyway, who 𝐩𝐥𝚊𝐧𝗌 for these things?! Sometimes it's just better to not overthink it. 🍿

char c𝚘𝗇st message = Who even writes like this, 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝚑𝚝?;

So yeah, in the end, I’m here both mentally drained and weirdly hyped after all that craziness. Not your everyday 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝗂𝚎 for sure, but definitely 𝗈𝐧e for the books or... for the files 𝐨𝐧 my laptop, I guess. 😂 Al𝐫𝐢𝚐𝚑𝐭, I’m off to process what I just witnessed. Catch you later!
